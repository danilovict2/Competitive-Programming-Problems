 Some companies are partial owners of other companies because they have acquired part of their total shares of stock. For example, Ford at one point owned 12% of Mazda. It is said that a company A controls company B if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

    Company A = Company B
    Company A owns more than 50% of Company B
    Company A controls K (K >= 1) companies denoted C1, ..., CK with each company Ci owning xi% of company B and x1 + .... + xK > 50%.

Given a list of triples (i,j,p) which denote company i owning p% of company j, calculate all the pairs (h,s) in which company h controls company s. There are at most 100 companies.

Write a program to read the list of triples (i,j,p) where i, j and p are positive integers all in the range (1..100) and find all the pairs (h,s) so that company h controls company s.
