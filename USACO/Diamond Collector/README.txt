Bessie the cow, always a fan of shiny objects, has taken up a hobby of mining diamonds in her spare time! She has collected N diamonds (Nâ‰¤1000) of varying sizes, and she wants to arrange some of them in a display case in the barn.

Since Bessie wants the diamonds in the case to be relatively similar in size, she decides that she will not include two diamonds in the case if their sizes differ by more than K
(two diamonds can be displayed together in the case if their sizes differ by exactly K). Given K, please help Bessie determine the maximum number of diamonds she can display in the case.
