In order to improve their physical fitness, the cows have taken up gymnastics! Farmer John designates his favorite cow Bessie to coach the N other cows and to assess their progress as they learn various gymnastic skills.

In each of K
practice sessions (1≤K≤10), Bessie ranks the N cows according to their performance (1≤N≤20

). Afterward, she is curious about the consistency in these rankings. A pair of two distinct cows is consistent if one cow did better than the other one in every practice session.

Help Bessie compute the total number of consistent pairs.
