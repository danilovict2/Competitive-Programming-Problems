Farmer John is worried for the health of his cows after an outbreak of the highly contagious bovine disease COWVID-19.

In order to limit transmission of the disease, Farmer John's N
cows (2≤N≤105) have decided to practice "social distancing" and spread themselves out across the farm. The farm is shaped like a 1D number line, with M mutually-disjoint intervals (1≤M≤105) in which there is grass for grazing. The cows want to locate themselves at distinct integer points, each covered in grass, so as to maximize the value of D, where D represents the distance between the closest pair of cows. Please help the cows determine the largest possible value of D.
