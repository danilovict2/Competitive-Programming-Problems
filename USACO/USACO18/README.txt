 Consider the number triangle shown below. Write a program that calculates the highest sum of numbers that can be passed on a route that starts at the top and ends somewhere on the base. Each step can go either diagonally down to the left or diagonally down to the right.

          7

        3   8

      8   1   0

    2   7   4   4

  4   5   2   6   5

In the sample above, the route from 7 to 3 to 8 to 7 to 5 produces the highest sum: 30.
