Bessie is running a race of length K (1≤K≤109) meters. She starts running at a speed of 0 meters per second. In a given second, she can either increase her speed by 1 meter per second, keep it unchanged, or decrease it by 1 meter per second. For example, in the first second, she can increase her speed to 1 meter per second and run 1 meter, or keep it at 0 meters per second and run 0 meters. Bessie's speed can never drop below zero.

Bessie will always run toward the finish line, and she wants to finish after an integer amount of seconds (ending either at or past the goal line at this integer point in time). Furthermore, she doesn’t want to be running too quickly at the finish line: at the instant in time when Bessie finishes running K
meters, she wants the speed she has just been traveling to be no more than X (1≤X≤105) meters per second. Bessie wants to know how quickly she can finish the race for N (1≤N≤1000) different values of X.
