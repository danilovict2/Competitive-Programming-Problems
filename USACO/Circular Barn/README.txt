Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built a new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn consists of a ring of n rooms, numbered clockwise from 1…n around the perimeter of the barn (3≤n≤1,000). Each room has doors to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to the exterior of the barn.

Farmer John wants exactly ri
cows to end up in each room i (1≤ri≤100). To herd the cows into the barn in an orderly fashion, he plans to unlock the exterior door of a single room, allowing the cows to enter through that door. Each cow then walks clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable destination. Farmer John wants to unlock the exterior door that will cause his cows to collectively walk a minimum total amount of distance. Please determine the minimum total distance his cows will need to walk, if he chooses the best such door to unlock. The distance walked by a single cow is the number of interior doors through which she passes.
