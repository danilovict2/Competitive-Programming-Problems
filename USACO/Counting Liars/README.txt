Bessie the cow is hiding somewhere along the number line. Each of Farmer John's N other cows (1≤N≤1000) have a piece of information to share: the i-th cow either says that Bessie is hiding at some location less than or equal to pi, or that Bessie is hiding at some location greater than or equal to pi (0≤pi≤109

).

Unfortunately, it is possible that no hiding location is consistent with the answers of all of the cows, meaning that not all of the cows are telling the truth. Count the minimum number of cows that must be lying.
