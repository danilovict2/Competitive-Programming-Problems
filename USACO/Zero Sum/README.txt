 Consider the sequence of digits from 1 through N (where N=9) in increasing order: 1 2 3 ... N.

Now insert either a `+' for addition or a `-' for subtraction or a ` ' [blank] to run the digits together between each pair of digits (not in front of the first digit). Calculate the result that of the expression and see if you get zero.

Write a program that will find all sequences of length N that produce a zero sum.
