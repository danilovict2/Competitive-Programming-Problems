Two people are playing a game with a string s

, consisting of lowercase latin letters.

On a player's turn, he should choose two consecutive equal letters in the string and delete them.

For example, if the string is equal to "xaax" than there is only one possible turn: delete "aa", so the string will become "xx". A player not able to make a turn loses.

Your task is to determine which player will win if both play optimally.
