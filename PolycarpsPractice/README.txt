Let's consider all integers in the range from 1
to n

(inclusive).

Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of gcd(a,b)
, where 1≤a<b≤n

.

The greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b)
, of two positive integers a and b is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both a and b.
