Luke likes to eat. There are n piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The i-th pile contains ai

units of food.

Luke will walk from the 1
-st pile towards the n-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the i-th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if |v−ai|≤x, where x is a fixed integer, and v

is Luke's food affinity.

Before Luke starts to walk, he can set v
to any integer. Also, for each i (1≤i≤n), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the i

-th pile.

Find the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food.

Note that the initial choice for v
is not considered as a change.
