You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,an consisting of n

pairwise distinct positive integers.

Find ⌊n2⌋
different pairs of integers x and y

such that:

    x≠y

;
x
and y appear in a
;
x mod y
doesn't appear in a

    . 

Note that some x
or y

can belong to multiple pairs.

⌊x⌋
denotes the floor function — the largest integer less than or equal to x. x mod y denotes the remainder from dividing x by y

.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be shown that at least one solution always exists.
