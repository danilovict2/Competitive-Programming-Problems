The number has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: , , , and . Similarly we can work from right to left: , , , and

.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE:
, , , and are not considered to be truncatable primes.
