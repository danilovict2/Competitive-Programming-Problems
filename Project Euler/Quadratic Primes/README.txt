Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

It turns out that the formula will produce primes for the consecutive integer values . However, when is divisible by , and certainly when is clearly divisible by

.

The incredible formula
was discovered, which produces primes for the consecutive values . The product of the coefficients, and , is

.

Considering quadratics of the form:

, where and

where
is the modulus/absolute value of
e.g. and

Find the product of the coefficients,
and , for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of , starting with .
