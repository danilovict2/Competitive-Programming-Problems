Consider the fraction,
, where and are positive integers. If and

, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for
in ascending order of size, we get:
It can be seen that there are fractions between
and

.

How many fractions lie between
and
in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for ?
