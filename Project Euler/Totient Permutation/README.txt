Euler's totient function, [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to which are relatively prime to . For example, as , and , are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, .
The number is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so

.

Interestingly,
, and it can be seen that is a permutation of

.

Find the value of
, , for which is a permutation of and the ratio

produces a minimum.
