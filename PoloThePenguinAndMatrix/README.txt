Little penguin Polo has an n × m matrix, consisting of integers. Let's index the matrix rows from 1 to n from top to bottom and let's index the columns from 1 to m from left to right. Let's represent the matrix element on the intersection of row i and column j as aij.

In one move the penguin can add or subtract number d from some matrix element. Find the minimum number of moves needed to make all matrix elements equal. If the described plan is impossible to carry out, say so.
