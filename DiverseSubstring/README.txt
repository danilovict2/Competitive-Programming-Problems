You are given a string s, consisting of n

lowercase Latin letters.

A substring of string s
is a continuous segment of letters from s

. For example, "defor" is a substring of "codeforces" and "fors" is not.

The length of the substring is the number of letters in it.

Let's call some string of length n
diverse if and only if there is no letter to appear strictly more than n2

times. For example, strings "abc" and "iltlml" are diverse and strings "aab" and "zz" are not.

Your task is to find any diverse substring of string s
or report that there is none. Note that it is not required to maximize or minimize the length of the resulting substring.
