For years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the n days of summer. On the i-th day, ai millimeters of rain will fall. All values ai

are distinct.

The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather x
days before the celebration and y days after. Because of that, he says that a day d is not-so-rainy if ad is smaller than rain amounts at each of x days before day d and and each of y days after day d. In other words, ad<aj should hold for all d−x≤j<d and d<j≤d+y. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such j that 1≤j≤n

.

Help mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.
