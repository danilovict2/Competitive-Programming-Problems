You are given n strings s1,s2,…,sn of length at most 8

.

For each string si
, determine if there exist two strings sj and sk such that si=sj+sk. That is, si is the concatenation of sj and sk. Note that j can be equal to k

.

Recall that the concatenation of strings s
and t is s+t=s1s2…spt1t2…tq, where p and q are the lengths of strings s and t respectively. For example, concatenation of "code" and "forces" is "codeforces".
