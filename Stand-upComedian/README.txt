Eve is a beginner stand-up comedian. Her first show gathered a grand total of two spectators: Alice and Bob.

Eve prepared a1+a2+a3+a4

jokes to tell, grouped by their type:

    type 1: both Alice and Bob like them;
    type 2: Alice likes them, but Bob doesn't;
    type 3: Bob likes them, but Alice doesn't;
    type 4: neither Alice nor Bob likes them. 

Initially, both spectators have their mood equal to 0
. When a spectator hears a joke he/she likes, his/her mood increases by 1. When a spectator hears a joke he/she doesn't like, his/her mood decreases by 1

. If the mood of a spectator becomes negative (strictly below zero), he/she leaves.

When someone leaves, Eve gets sad and ends the show. If no one leaves, and Eve is out of jokes, she also ends the show.

Thus, Eve wants to arrange her jokes in such a way that the show lasts as long as possible. Help her to calculate the maximum number of jokes she can tell before the show ends.
