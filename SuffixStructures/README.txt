Bizon the Champion isn't just a bison. He also is a favorite of the "Bizons" team.

At a competition the "Bizons" got the following problem: "You are given two distinct words (strings of English letters), s and t. You need to transform word s into word t". The task looked simple to the guys because they know the suffix data structures well. Bizon Senior loves suffix automaton. By applying it once to a string, he can remove from this string any single character. Bizon Middle knows suffix array well. By applying it once to a string, he can swap any two characters of this string. The guys do not know anything about the suffix tree, but it can help them do much more.

Bizon the Champion wonders whether the "Bizons" can solve the problem. Perhaps, the solution do not require both data structures. Find out whether the guys can solve the problem and if they can, how do they do it? Can they solve it either only with use of suffix automaton or only with use of suffix array or they need both structures? Note that any structure may be used an unlimited number of times, the structures may be used in any order.
