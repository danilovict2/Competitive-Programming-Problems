Vasya has got n books, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a stack. The topmost book has number a1, the next one — a2, and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number an

. All numbers are distinct.

Vasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in n
steps. During i-th step he wants to move the book number bi into his backpack. If the book with number bi is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book bi, and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order [1,2,3] (book 1 is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order [2,1,3], then during the first step he will move two books (1 and 2), during the second step he will do nothing (since book 1 is already in the backpack), and during the third step — one book (the book number 3). Note that b1,b2,…,bn

are distinct.

Help Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.
