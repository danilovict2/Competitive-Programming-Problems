You took a peek on Thanos wearing Infinity Gauntlet. In the Gauntlet there is a place for six Infinity Gems:

    the Power Gem of purple color,
    the Time Gem of green color,
    the Space Gem of blue color,
    the Soul Gem of orange color,
    the Reality Gem of red color,
    the Mind Gem of yellow color. 

Using colors of Gems you saw in the Gauntlet determine the names of absent Gems.
