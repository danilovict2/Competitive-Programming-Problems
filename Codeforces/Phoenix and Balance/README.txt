Phoenix has n coins with weights 21,22,…,2n. He knows that n

is even.

He wants to split the coins into two piles such that each pile has exactly n2
coins and the difference of weights between the two piles is minimized. Formally, let a denote the sum of weights in the first pile, and b denote the sum of weights in the second pile. Help Phoenix minimize |a−b|, the absolute value of a−b.
