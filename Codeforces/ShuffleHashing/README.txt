Polycarp has built his own web service. Being a modern web service it includes login feature. And that always implies password security problems.

Polycarp decided to store the hash of the password, generated by the following algorithm:

    take the password p

, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and shuffle the letters randomly in it to obtain p′ (p′ can still be equal to p
);
generate two random strings, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, s1
and s2
(any of these strings can be empty);
the resulting hash h=s1+p′+s2

    , where addition is string concatenation. 

For example, let the password p=
"abacaba". Then p′ can be equal to "aabcaab". Random strings s1= "zyx" and s2= "kjh". Then h=

"zyxaabcaabkjh".

Note that no letters could be deleted or added to p
to obtain p′

, only the order could be changed.

Now Polycarp asks you to help him to implement the password check module. Given the password p
and the hash h, check that h can be the hash for the password p

.

Your program should answer t
independent test cases.
