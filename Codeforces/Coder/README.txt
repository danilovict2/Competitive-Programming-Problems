Iahub likes chess very much. He even invented a new chess piece named Coder. A Coder can move (and attack) one square horizontally or vertically. More precisely, if the Coder is located at position (x, y), he can move to (or attack) positions (x + 1, y), (x–1, y), (x, y + 1) and (x, y–1).

Iahub wants to know how many Coders can be placed on an n × n chessboard, so that no Coder attacks any other Coder.
