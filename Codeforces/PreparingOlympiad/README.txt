You have n problems. You have estimated the difficulty of the i-th one as integer ci. Now you want to prepare a problemset for a contest, using some of the problems you've made.

A problemset for the contest must consist of at least two problems. You think that the total difficulty of the problems of the contest must be at least l and at most r. Also, you think that the difference between difficulties of the easiest and the hardest of the chosen problems must be at least x.

Find the number of ways to choose a problemset for the contest.
