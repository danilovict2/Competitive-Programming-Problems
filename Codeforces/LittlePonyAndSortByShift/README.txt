One day, Twilight Sparkle is interested in how to sort a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an in non-decreasing order. Being a young unicorn, the only operation she can perform is a unit shift. That is, she can move the last element of the sequence to its beginning:
a1, a2, ..., an → an, a1, a2, ..., an - 1.

Help Twilight Sparkle to calculate: what is the minimum number of operations that she needs to sort the sequence?
