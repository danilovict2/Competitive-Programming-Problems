Rudolf is on his way to the castle. Before getting into the castle, the security staff asked him a question:

Given two binary numbers a
and b of length n. How many different ways of swapping two digits in a (only in a, not b) so that bitwise OR of these two numbers will be changed? In other words, let c be the bitwise OR of a and b, you need to find the number of ways of swapping two bits in a so that bitwise OR will not be equal to c

.

Note that binary numbers can contain leading zeros so that length of each number is exactly n

.

Bitwise OR is a binary operation. A result is a binary number which contains a one in each digit if there is a one in at least one of the two numbers. For example, 010102
OR 100112 = 110112

.

Well, to your surprise, you are not Rudolf, and you don't need to help himâ€¦
You are the security staff! Please find the number of ways of swapping two bits in a so that bitwise OR will be changed.
