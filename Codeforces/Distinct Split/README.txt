Let's denote the f(x) function for a string x as the number of distinct characters that the string contains. For example f(abc)=3, f(bbbbb)=1, and f(babacaba)=3

.

Given a string s
, split it into two non-empty strings a and b such that f(a)+f(b) is the maximum possible. In other words, find the maximum possible value of f(a)+f(b) such that a+b=s (the concatenation of string a and string b is equal to string s).
