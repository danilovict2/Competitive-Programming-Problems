Polycarpus loves hamburgers very much. He especially adores the hamburgers he makes with his own hands. Polycarpus thinks that there are only three decent ingredients to make hamburgers from: a bread, sausage and cheese. He writes down the recipe of his favorite "Le Hamburger de Polycarpus" as a string of letters 'B' (bread), 'S' (sausage) и 'C' (cheese). The ingredients in the recipe go from bottom to top, for example, recipe "ВSCBS" represents the hamburger where the ingredients go from bottom to top as bread, sausage, cheese, bread and sausage again.
