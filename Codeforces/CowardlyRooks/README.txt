There's a chessboard of size n√ón. m

rooks are placed on it in such a way that:

    no two rooks occupy the same cell;
    no two rooks attack each other. 

A rook attacks all cells that are in its row or column.

Is it possible to move exactly one rook (you can choose which one to move) into a different cell so that no two rooks still attack each other? A rook can move into any cell in its row or column if no other rook stands on its path.
