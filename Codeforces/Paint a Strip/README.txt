You have an array of zeros a1,a2,…,an of length n

.

You can perform two types of operations on it:

    Choose an index i

such that 1≤i≤n and ai=0, and assign 1 to ai
;
Choose a pair of indices l
and r such that 1≤l≤r≤n, al=1, ar=1, al+…+ar≥⌈r−l+12⌉, and assign 1 to ai for all l≤i≤r

    . 

What is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?
