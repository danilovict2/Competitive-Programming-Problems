One day a highly important task was commissioned to Vasya â€” writing a program in a night. The program consists of n lines of code. Vasya is already exhausted, so he works like that: first he writes v lines of code, drinks a cup of tea, then he writes as much as lines, drinks another cup of tea, then he writes lines and so on: , , , ...

The expression is regarded as the integral part from dividing number a by number b.

The moment the current value equals 0, Vasya immediately falls asleep and he wakes up only in the morning, when the program should already be finished.

Vasya is wondering, what minimum allowable value v can take to let him write not less than n lines of code before he falls asleep.
