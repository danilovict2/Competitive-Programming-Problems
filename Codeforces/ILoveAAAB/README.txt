Let's call a string good if its length is at least 2 and all of its characters are A except for the last character which is B. The good strings are AB,AAB,AAAB,â€¦. Note that B

is not a good string.

You are given an initially empty string s1

.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

    Choose any position of s1

    and insert some good string in that position. 

Given a string s2
, can we turn s1 into s2

after some number of operations?
