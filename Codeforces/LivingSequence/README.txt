In Japan, the number 4 reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence. Living sequence a contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit 4. a=[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,â€¦]

.

For example, the number 1235
is part of the sequence a, but the numbers 4321, 443 are not part of the sequence a

.

Bob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position k

in the sequence, so he asks for your help.

For example, if Bob wants to find the number at position k=4
(indexing from 1), you need to answer ak=5.
