Given the integer n

 â€” the number of available blocks. You must use all blocks to build a pedestal.

The pedestal consists of 3
platforms for 2-nd, 1-st and 3-rd places respectively. The platform for the 1-st place must be strictly higher than for the 2-nd place, and the platform for the 2-nd place must be strictly higher than for the 3

-rd place. Also, the height of each platform must be greater than zero (that is, each platform must contain at least one block).
Example pedestal of n=11
blocks: second place height equals 4 blocks, first place height equals 5 blocks, third place height equals 2
blocks.

Among all possible pedestals of n
blocks, deduce one such that the platform height for the 1-st place minimum as possible. If there are several of them, output any of them.
