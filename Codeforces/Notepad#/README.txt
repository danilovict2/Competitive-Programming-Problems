You want to type the string s, consisting of n

lowercase Latin letters, using your favorite text editor Notepad#.

Notepad# supports two kinds of operations:

    append any letter to the end of the string;
    copy a continuous substring of an already typed string and paste this substring to the end of the string. 

Can you type string s
in strictly less than n operations?
