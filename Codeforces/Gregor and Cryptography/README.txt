Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand how RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.

Gregor's favorite prime number is P
. Gregor wants to find two bases of P. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers a and b

which satisfy both of the following properties.

    Pmoda=Pmodb

, where xmody denotes the remainder when x is divided by y
, and
2≤a<b≤P

    . 

Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!
