You are given n
numbers a1,a2,…,an

. With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:

Choose one of these numbers and add or subtract 1

from it.

In particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.

We want to make the product of all these numbers equal to 1
, in other words, we want a1⋅a2 … ⋅an=1

.

For example, for n=3
and numbers [1,−3,0] we can make product equal to 1 in 3 coins: add 1 to second element, add 1 to second element again, subtract 1 from third element, so that array becomes [1,−1,−1]. And 1⋅(−1)⋅(−1)=1

.

What is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?
