While rummaging through things in a distant drawer, Anya found a beautiful string s

consisting only of zeros and ones.

Now she wants to make it even more beautiful by performing q

operations on it.

Each operation is described by two integers i
(1≤i≤|s|) and v (v∈{0,1}) and means that the i-th character of the string is assigned the value v (that is, the assignment si=v

is performed).

But Anya loves the number 1100
, so after each query, she asks you to tell her whether the substring "1100" is present in her string (i.e. there exist such 1≤i≤|s|−3 that sisi+1si+2si+3=1100).
