You are given a positive integer x. Check whether the number x

is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.

Formally, you need to check if there are two integers a
and b (1â‰¤a,b) such that a3+b3=x

.

For example, if x=35
, then the numbers a=2 and b=3 are suitable (23+33=8+27=35). If x=4, then no pair of numbers a and b is suitable.
