Given a positive integer k, two arrays are called k

-similar if:

    they are strictly increasing;
    they have the same length;
    all their elements are positive integers between 1

and k

    (inclusive);
    they differ in exactly one position. 

You are given an integer k
, a strictly increasing array a and q queries. For each query, you are given two integers li≤ri. Your task is to find how many arrays b exist, such that b is k-similar to array [ali,ali+1…,ari].
