Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is struggling with his homework – a number division problem.

There are n
positive integers a1,a2,…,an on Bob's homework paper, where n is always an even number. Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least 2 numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into m groups, and the sum of the numbers in the j-th group is sj. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of sj, that is
∑j=1ms2j.

Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?
