Given two integers n and x

, construct an array that satisfies the following conditions:

    for any element ai

in the array, 1â‰¤ai<2n
;
there is no non-empty subsegment with bitwise XOR equal to 0
or x
,
its length l

    should be maximized. 

A sequence b
is a subsegment of a sequence a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
