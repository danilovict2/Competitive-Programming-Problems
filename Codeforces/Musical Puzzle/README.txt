Vlad decided to compose a melody on his guitar. Let's represent the melody as a sequence of notes corresponding to the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', and 'g'.

For example, if Vlad recorded the melodies "ab" and "ba", he can merge them together and obtain the melody "aba", and then merge the result with "ab" to get "abab".

Help Vlad determine the minimum number of melodies consisting of two notes that he needs to record in order to obtain the melody s
