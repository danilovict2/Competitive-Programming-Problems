You are given two arrays a and b, both consisting of n

integers.

In one move, you can choose two indices i
and j (1≤i,j≤n; i≠j) and swap ai with aj and bi with bj

. You have to perform the swap in both arrays.

You are allowed to perform at most 104
moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.
