You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a≥x and b≥y. You can do the following operation no more than n

times:

    Choose either a

or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y

    . 

Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a
and b (a⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n

times.

You have to answer t
independent test cases.
