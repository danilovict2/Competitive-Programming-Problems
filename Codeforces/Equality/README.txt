You are given a string s
of length n, which consists only of the first k letters of the Latin alphabet. All letters in string s

are uppercase.

A subsequence of string s
is a string that can be derived from s

by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, "ADE" and "BD" are subsequences of "ABCDE", but "DEA" is not.

A subsequence of s
called good if the number of occurences of each of the first k

letters of the alphabet is the same.

Find the length of the longest good subsequence of s

.
