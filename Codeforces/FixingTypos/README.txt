Many modern text editors automatically check the spelling of the user's text. Some editors even suggest how to correct typos.

In this problem your task to implement a small functionality to correct two types of typos in a word. We will assume that three identical letters together is a typo (for example, word "helllo" contains a typo). Besides, a couple of identical letters immediately followed by another couple of identical letters is a typo too (for example, words "helloo" and "wwaatt" contain typos).

Write a code that deletes the minimum number of letters from a word, correcting described typos in the word. You are allowed to delete letters from both ends and from the middle of the word.
