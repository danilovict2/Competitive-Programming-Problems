You are given two integers n and k

.

Your task is to construct such a string s
of length n that for each i from 1 to k there is at least one i

-th letter of the Latin alphabet in this string (the first letter is 'a', the second is 'b' and so on) and there are no other letters except these. You have to maximize the minimal frequency of some letter (the frequency of a letter is the number of occurrences of this letter in a string). If there are several possible answers, you can print any.

You have to answer t
independent queries.
