Permutation p is an ordered set of integers p1,  p2,  ...,  pn, consisting of n distinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. We'll denote the i-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size or the length of permutation p1,  p2,  ...,  pn.

You have a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. In one move, you are allowed to decrease or increase any number by one. Count the minimum number of moves, needed to build a permutation from this sequence.
