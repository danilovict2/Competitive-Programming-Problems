Ehab has an array a of length n. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of n

copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?

A sequence a
is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.
