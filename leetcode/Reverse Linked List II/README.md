Reverse Linked List II

You are given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right (1-indexed), and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 1, right = 3

Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1], left = 1, right = 1

Output: [1,1]

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is n.
    1 <= n <= 500.
    -500 <= Node.val <= 500
    1 <= left <= right <= n
