Word Search II

Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a list of strings words, return all words that are present in the grid.

For a word to be present it must be possible to form the word with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example 1:

Input:
board = [
  ["a","b","c","d"],
  ["s","a","a","t"],
  ["a","c","k","e"],
  ["a","c","d","n"]
],
words = ["bat","cat","back","backend","stack"]

Output: ["cat","back","backend"]

Example 2:

Input:
board = [
  ["x","o"],
  ["x","o"]
],
words = ["xoxo"]

Output: []

Constraints:

    1 <= board.length, board[i].length <= 12
    board[i] consists only of lowercase English letter.
    1 <= words.length <= 30,000
    1 <= words[i].length <= 10
    words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
    All strings within words are distinct.
